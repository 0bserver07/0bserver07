## Hey, I'm Yad

Hacking on new things for fun and learning. I build agent driven systems, data pipelines, and whatever else needs to exist to make world a better place.

### Tinkering

- 🧭 [Erdos Navigator](https://github.com/0bserver07/erdos-navigator) – Agent navigator that turns Claude Code into a theorem proving assistant
- 🎓 [AgenticEngineer.ING](https://agenticengineer.ing) – Interactive lessons to become an agent-driven engineer across any domain
- 🍄 [Mycelium Theme](https://github.com/0bserver07/mycelium-theme) – Digital garden, Obsidian workflow, and blog in one
- ✍️ [yad.codes](https://yad.codes) – Technical blog and digital garden
- 🚀 Novalis ⏳ – AI-native terminal built with Tauri and xterm.js
- 🗄️ MCPantry ⏳ – Desktop app to manage MCP servers, skills, plugins, and agent configs across your AI tools
- 📡 StackUnderflow ⏳ – Local Q&A forum and analytics for your Claude Code agent sessions
- 🌐 CodingAgents.Dev ⏳ – Link aggregator and community for coding agents
- 🎮 Claude Code Games 101 ⏳ – Learn Claude Code by building games

### Background

- Cofounded [KayOS](https://kayos.ai) – Built 13 production AI platforms across legal tech, marketing analytics, and BI. Developed agent infrastructure (knowledge graphs, AI sandboxes, ETL frameworks) and a full AI coding IDE with ACP integration. 21k+ commits across 65 repos.
- Before that: Data / ML at NEAR Foundation (770M+ blockchain transactions), Be On Deck, and RobyAI.

### Open Source

- Contributed to [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/3417) and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6035) – bug fixes and API improvements in the early deep learning ecosystem
- [Desc2Code](https://github.com/0bserver07/desc2code) – Early research on neural code generation from natural language descriptions
- [One-Hundred-Layers-Tiramisu](https://github.com/0bserver07/One-Hundred-Layers-Tiramisu) – Semantic segmentation in Keras
- [Nvidia-Autopilot-Keras](https://github.com/0bserver07/Nvidia-Autopilot-Keras) – End-to-end self-driving in Keras
- [Keras-SegNet-Basic](https://github.com/0bserver07/Keras-SegNet-Basic) – SegNet for semantic segmentation in Keras
